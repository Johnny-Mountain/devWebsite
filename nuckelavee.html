                    The nuckelavee is the most malevolent of the mythical creatures from the Scottish islands and has no redeeming qualities at all, preferring to cause mayhem and destruction whenever it can. During the summer months it is imprisoned in the depths of the sea by the powerful spirit The Mither O'the Sea.
                    <br><br>
                    It is a unique creature with toxic breath which can wither crops and cause disease in livestock and humans. The nukelavee hates the smell of burning seaweed which will send it into a fit of rage. Once enraged it will kill fields of cattle and only the only being that can stop it is The Mither O'the Sea.
                    <br><br>
                    The nuckalavee resembles a human with a large head which is merged along the back of a horse's body, like some kind of strange centaur, and it has no skin. Black blood flows through yellow veins and the sinews and muscles are visible as a throbbing mass. It is strongly built and stands nearly 6 feet tall at it's horse head and about 9 feet at it's humanoid head. 
                    <br><br>
                    Like many mythical sea-creatures it has an aversion to fresh water and any who are chased by it have only to cross a stream to be rid of it.
